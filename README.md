# Project Title

This project is similar to [Greater Goods](https://greatergoods.com/) and it is developed using MEAN Stack.

## Overview of MEAN

* MEAN is a collection of JavaScript-based technologies ([**M**ongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)(Database), [**E**xpress.js](http://expressjs.com/)(Web Framework), [**A**ngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)(Front-end Framework), and [**N**ode.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)(Application Server)) used to develop web applications.
* From the client and server sides to databases, MEAN is a full-stack development toolkit.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* [Internet Information Services (IIS)](https://www.iis.net)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Node.js®](https://nodejs.org/en/)

#### Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. ([Source](https://git-scm.com/))

We need to install IIS in order for us to manage changes to source code over time.
* [Install Git on Windows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git/mac-os-x)

#### Internet Information Services (IIS)

Internet Information Services (IIS) for Windows® Server is a flexible, secure and manageable Web server for hosting anything on the Web. From media streaming to web applications, IIS's scalable and open architecture is ready to handle the most demanding tasks. ([Source](https://www.iis.net/))

We need to install IIS in order to run the MEAN Stack in Windows® Server.
* [Install IIS 7](https://www.iis.net/learn/install/installing-iis-7/installing-iis-on-windows-vista-and-windows-7)

#### MongoDB

MongoDB is an open source, document-oriented database designed with both scalability and developer agility in mind. Instead of storing your data in tables and rows as you would with a relational database, in MongoDB you store JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. The goal of MongoDB is to bridge the gap between key-value stores (which are fast and scalable) and relational databases (which have rich functionality).

#### Node.js®

Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world. ([Source](https://nodejs.org/en/))

Download the Node.js source code or a pre-built installer for your platform.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
