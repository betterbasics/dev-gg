Like all of our brands, Rise was built in collaboration with a charity partner, so our coffee can give back at every point along its journey.

Rise is committed to a healthy planet, and we wanted to do more for the environment than sustainably manufacture our coffee. We wanted to reverse the effects of existing pollution, and so we partnered with the experts at Pure Earth. Contaminated sites are an unpublicized but widespread problem, affecting more than 200 million people worldwide—a number similar to those affected by malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis. Women and children are especially vulnerable, sometimes suffering brain damage or an early death as a result. From abandoned mines to the poisonous components released while recycling electronics, dangerous pollutants are a fact of life in many third-world communities. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Pure Earth works with local citizens and authorities to clean up existing sites and educate the public to prevent future hazards. So far, Pure Earth has improved 80 sites, affecting more than 4 million people—including 800,000 children younger than six.</p>\n  </div>\n</div> <!-- end row -->\n\n<!-- NOT FULL WIDTH -->\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2\">\n    <img src=\"http://media.greatergoods.com/images/original/o6qmxm2q02.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive center\" alt=\"\" style=\"width:100%; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 400ms;\">\n    <div class=\"caption\">To date, Pure Earth has restored sites in 20 countries, making life better for 4.2 million people.</div>\n  </div>\n</div> <!-- end row !fullWidth -->\n\n<div class=\"row bottom\">\n  <div class=\"col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1\">\n    <p>At Greater Goods, we believe in manufacturing our products responsibly, and using a portion of the profits to support organizations working to build a better world.

Of the estimated 150 million orphans worldwide today, many were not created by the loss of a parent—they were created by the lack of economic opportunities in their community. One way to keep families together, the GO Project thought, would be to create living-wage jobs in the communities where they were already serving orphans. They also focus on providing education and vocational training for the children in their care as they grow up.

Connect was built in partnership with Pathways, an initiative by the Global Orphan Project that helps orphaned teenagers bridge the gap between foster care and the adult world. By providing job training and other resources, Pathways helps these children build their futures. </p>\n  </div>\n</div> <!-- end row -->\n\n<!-- FULL WIDTH -->\n<div parallax-background parallax-ratio=\"0.9\" class=\"parallaxImage\" style=\"background-image:url('http://media.greatergoods.com/images/original/4ivx6ulyz6.jpg')\">\n<div class=\"parallaxCaption\">We partnered with a factory in Fo Shan, China that values treating its workers well.</div>\n</div>\n<!-- end row FULL WIDTH -->\n\n<!-- COMBO -->\n<div class=\"row combo\">\n  <div class=\"col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-lg-3 col-lg-offset-2\">\n    <img src=\"http://media.greatergoods.com/images/original/ykyrsk8stb.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" alt=\"\" style=\"opacity: 1; transition: opacity 400ms;\">\n    <div class=\"caption\">The Fo Shan team has years of expertise in electronics manufacturing.</div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-lg-4 col-lg-offset-1\">\n    <h2>Responsible Manufacturing</h2>\n    <p>To make Connect products, we’ve partnered with a factory in Foshan, China that is committed to providing a safe, clean environment and a decent wage for their workers.

They soon realized, however, that these children often left orphan care programs with little education or job training. When they turned 18, they lost the support of the system without being prepared to provide for themselves. The Pathways program provides two years of hands-on work and life skills training, so teenagers transition out of the foster care system ready to earn a living and be an active part of their community. When you purchase a Connect product, we collect a small part of your order and combine it with hundreds of others to help Pathways prepare children in need for the future.\n </p>\n  </div>\n</div> <!-- end row -->\n\n<!-- NOT FULL WIDTH -->\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2\">\n    <img src=\"http://media.greatergoods.com/images/original/r86htgr5c1.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive center\" alt=\"\" style=\"width:100%; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 400ms;\">\n    <div class=\"caption\">Through Pathways, the GO Project helps teenagers in orphan care get hands-on job and life skills training.</div>\n  </div>\n</div> <!-- end row !fullWidth -->",
