This is true regardless of the manufacturer or method of measurement. Our scale uses BIA (bioelectric impedance analysis). What this means is that a small electrical current passes through your body to measure resistance. This number is combined in our algorithm with other factors, such as gender, age, weight, height and activity level, to estimate body composition. Because of this, the numbers you see on your scale may vary from those you see using other measurement methods. This is completely normal.</p><p><br/></p><p>The most important thing with body composition is to pay more attention to the trends than the day to day numbers. You'll have a better view of how things are really going by watching how the numbers change month to month. Tracking on the App helps with that.</p>",

If that’s the case, the easiest solution is to manually select yourself before weighing. This can also resolve the issue if you don’t weigh within 10lbs of the other user but are still experiencing a user conflict due to a misweigh. To manually select yourself, wake the scale up and use the arrow button to go to your profile, then press SEL and weigh.</p><p><br/></p><p>If you still experience the user conflict or there is only one user on the scale, you can also try deleting the conflicting profile. To do this, wake the scale up and let it settle at 0.0. Next, press and hold the SEL button. Once U1 starts flashing, let go of SEL and use the arrow button to go to the user number you want to delete; once you get there, press the SEL button again. Clr N should appear on the screen. Change the N to a Y using the arrow button and then press SEL one more time. The scale should shut off. This means the profile has been cleared and the conflict should be resolved.</p>",

Our scale has a feature called “auto-on” which allows users to just step on and weigh without first calibrating the scale. If you keep your scale stored away instead of in the same place, that feature won’t work correctly. The scale calibrates itself when it turns off, so if it’s then moved into a cabinet for example, the weight of the scale itself may not be properly accounted for, causing a swing in weight by up to 4-5 pounds.</p><p><br/></p><p>We understand that many bathrooms are too small to keep the scale out at all times, so an easy fix for this problem is to let the scale calibrate before you weigh yourself. To do this, simply place it on a hard, flat surface, then press it awake and let it go to 0.0. Once it has zeroed out, it will be calibrated and you can step on to weigh yourself.</p>",

Your body composition is estimated using an algorithm to combine the numbers gathered from the bioimpedance analysis and your gender, height, age, and activity level to give your body composition numbers.

Once you’ve opened your first bag of coffee, we suggest you fold it shut with the provided tape-down to keep it fresh. You can then push it back into the box or just keep it near by for easy access.

        "answer": "<p>Unfortunately, you cannot store our cups in an open-air carousel like many people use for traditional plastic cups. Our cups are not individually sealed. They’re packed 6 per bag, and if they were left out, the coffee would turn stale very quickly. Although this could be perceived as a drawback of our cup-less format, the truth is, our nitrogen-flushed bags provide a fresher path to your cup at home. Our bags are 99% oxygen-free, while some single-serve cups contain up to 10% oxygen, causing the coffee to become stale as it’s in transit to your home. Freshness is all about avoiding oxygen exposure from the moment the bean is roasted until the package is opened in your home. It may take several weeks to arrive, as most products pass through different trucks and warehouses to get to your home. If your coffee isn’t free of oxygen, it’ll begin going stale the minute it’s packaged at the roaster's facility.<br/></p>",

Your body composition is estimated using an algorithm to combine the numbers gathered from the bioimpedance analysis and your gender, height, age, and activity level to give your body composition numbers.

If that’s the case, the easiest solution is to manually select yourself before weighing. This can also resolve the issue if you don’t weigh within 10 lbs of the other user, but are still experiencing a user conflict due to a misweigh. To manually select yourself, wake the scale up and use the arrow button to go to your profile, then press SEL and weigh.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style=\"color: #000000;background-color: transparent;\">If you still experience the user conflict or there is only one user on the scale, you can also try deleting the conflicting profile. To do this, wake the scale up and let it settle at 0.0. Next, press and hold the SEL button. Once U1 starts flashing, let go of SEL and use the arrow button to go to the user number you want to delete; once you get there, press the SEL button again. Clr N should appear on the screen. Change the N to a Y using the arrow button and then press SEL one more time. The scale should shut off. This means the profile has been cleared and the conflict should be resolved.</span></p>",

Our scale has a feature called “auto-on” which allows users to just step on and weigh without first calibrating the scale. If you keep your scale stored away instead of in the same place, that feature won’t work correctly. The scale calibrates itself when it turns off, so if it’s then moved into a cabinet, for example, the weight of the scale itself may not be properly accounted for, causing a swing in weight by up to 4-5 pounds.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(80, 80, 80);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br/></p><p style=\"color: rgb(80, 80, 80);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">We understand that many bathrooms are too small to keep the scale out at all times, so an easy fix for this problem is to let the scale calibrate before you weigh yourself. To do this, simply place it on a hard, flat surface, then press it awake and let it go to 0.0. Once it has zeroed out, it will be calibrated and you can step on to weigh yourself.</p>",
